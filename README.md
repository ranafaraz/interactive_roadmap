# Interactive RoadMap LifeHub App

Welcome to the **Interactive RoadMap LifeHub App** repository. This project is a modular, scalable, SAAS-based educational platform built with Laravel, React, MySQL, and MongoDB. It supports third-party plugin integration and is designed for remote developer collaboration. The entire system is containerized using Docker and configured with a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: The app supports adding new features as separate modules.
- **Plugin Integration**: Similar to WordPress, developers can build and install plugins to extend the platformâ€™s functionality.
- **User Authentication and Role-Based Access Control**: The system supports different user roles such as Admin, Teacher, Student, and Developer.
- **CRUD Logs in MongoDB**: All data change operations are logged in MongoDB for auditing.
- **RESTful API**: The system provides a robust API to interact with the frontend and external services.
- **Dockerized Setup**: The app is containerized for ease of deployment and development.
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**: Continuous integration and deployment are set up using GitHub Actions.

## System Requirements

- **Docker** (latest version)
- **Docker Compose**
- **Git**
- **Node.js** (for frontend development)
- **Composer** (for Laravel dependencies)

## Setup Instructions

Follow these instructions to set up the Interactive RoadMap LifeHub App on your local machine using Docker.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/interactive-roadmap-lifehub.git
cd interactive-roadmap-lifehub

Docker Setup
Ensure that Docker is installed and running on your machine. The project uses Docker for local development and production. Docker Compose is used to manage multiple services (PHP, Nginx, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.).

Build the Docker containers:

bash

docker-compose build
Start the Docker containers:

bash

docker-compose up -d
This will start all the required services including PHP, MySQL, MongoDB, Nginx, and Node.js.

Environment Configuration
Copy the .env.example file to .env and update the necessary environment variables (database connection, mail configuration, etc.):

bash

cp .env.example .env
Generate a new application key for Laravel:

bash

docker-compose exec app php artisan key:generate
Update the database credentials in the .env file to match the Docker configuration:

bash

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=mysql
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=lifehub_db
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=root
For MongoDB configuration, also update the .env file:

bash

MONGO_DB_CONNECTION=mongodb
MONGO_DB_HOST=mongodb
MONGO_DB_PORT=27017
MONGO_DB_DATABASE=lifehub_logs
MONGO_DB_USERNAME=root
MONGO_DB_PASSWORD=root
Run the Application
Migrate the database:

bash

docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate
Install frontend dependencies:

bash

docker-compose exec app npm install
Build the frontend assets:

bash

docker-compose exec app npm run dev
Access the application: The application will be available at http://localhost:8000.

CI/CD Pipeline
The project is configured with GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). Each time a commit is pushed to the main branch, GitHub Actions will:

Run tests for both the backend and frontend.
Build the Docker image.
Deploy the application to a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean).
GitHub Actions Workflow
The CI/CD configuration file is located in .github/workflows/ci.yml. It defines the steps to run tests, build Docker containers, and push to the cloud.

Running Tests Locally
To run tests locally in the Docker container:

bash

docker-compose exec app php artisan test
For frontend testing:

bash

docker-compose exec app npm run test
API Documentation
The Interactive RoadMap LifeHub App provides a comprehensive API for interacting with the backend services.

Authentication
Most API routes require authentication via a JWT token. After logging in, include the token in the Authorization header for all subsequent requests.

Example:

```makefile
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
For detailed API documentation, refer to the API Documentation.

Plugin Development
The platform allows developers to create and install plugins to extend the functionality of the system.

Plugin Structure
A plugin consists of:

Backend (Laravel): Custom routes, controllers, and models.
Frontend (React): Components injected into the main application.

Installing a Plugin
Upload the plugin through the admin interface or place it in the plugins/ directory.

Run the plugin migration (if any):

```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate
```
Activate the plugin from the admin panel.

For detailed instructions on how to develop plugins, see the Plugin Developer Guide.
